<h2>Top 3 movies i watched recently </h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Avengers : Infinity war</h3>
  <p>This movie is in my list because i loved the vfx and fighting cinematography of the movie .. one of the favourite scenes of mine in the movie was whem thor attacks thanos with his thunderstorm.. and the part where thanos fights tony in his home planet ..overall the screen time divided for that many characters was very good</p>

<h3>2. Three Idiots</h3> 
  <p>well the story was good and the part where virus realises his mistakes and gave his pen to chanchad was one of the best part in the movie and as well as last scene of the movie was also good .. and the fact thet they tells us that how many children commits suicide because of our education system was one one the most important part of the movie i would say .</p>

<h3>3. Shadi me jarur aana</h3>
  <p>the beat part of the movie was its plot and how they made our protagnist from childish to so mature was the best part</p>
